**Abstract:**   
The plant hormone auxin is thought to provide positional information for
patterning during development. It is still unclear, however, precisely how
auxin is distributed across tissues and how the hormone is sensed in space and
time. The control of gene expression in response to auxin involves a complex
netwo rk of over 50 potentially interacting transcriptional activators and
repressors, the auxin response fac tors (ARFs) and Aux/IAAs. Here, we perform
a large-scale analysis of the Aux/IAA-ARF pathway in the sho ot apex of
Arabidopsis, where dynamic auxin-based patterning controls organogenesis. A
comprehensive ex pression map and full interactome uncovered an unexpectedly
simple distribution and structure of this p athway in the shoot apex. A
mathematical model of the Aux/IAA-ARF network predicted a strong buffering
capacity along with spatial differences in auxin sensitivity. We then tested
and confirmed these predic tions using a novel auxin signalling sensor that
reports input into the signalling pathway, in conjunct ion with the published
DR5 transcriptional output reporter. Our results provide evidence that the
auxin signalling network is essential to create robust patterns at the shoot
apex.

**Note:**

Figure 3 of the supplementary material of the reference article has been
reproduced here. Time evolution of all the variables in the model are plotted,
under the influence of a step input of auxin level (auxin=5, when time>1000;
0.11, otherwise). pi_A is varied between 0 and 2 by steps of 0.1.
